#### ABSTRACT:
Sentiment analysis in reviews, comments, tweets, captions is one of the trending projects right now in the DL and ML domains, we use the NLU engine to analyze the sentiments of the texts, as well as try to classify the labelled texts using BERT, Roberta models. This project focuses on the unlabeled where you can try to analyze the tweets of the hashtags using different libraries and based on your analysis you can make plots and make an observation from it, can understand the behaviour of the public sentiment at different times i.e may what is the curve of positivity in human sentiments during weekdays and weekends, how is the trend of the negativity curve during the month ends. For completing the goals datasets have been provided, as well as a demo is also added that how the datasets had been made.

#### TASKS:
  1. Use different natural language understanding scoring methods or libraries to determine the sentiment score of the hashtags, put your codes in a Jupyter Notebook. Here is a video about the NLU and sentiments analysis: ![Sentiment analysis types and approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBDoqMswK0)
  2. If you are done with part 1 of the task you can make the plots of the scores, based on weeks, days and months, keep them in part 2 of the same notebook. Here is a video, which will help you to create plots: ![Creating and Customizing Our First Plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI)
  3. If you want to do more after part 2 you can make a small report of your understanding based on your plots observations, write some discussions about them and that will be the end of the project.
